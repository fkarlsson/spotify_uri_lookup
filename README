Spotify URI Lookup Irssi Script - No more hatin' on the evil track links!

Parses Spotify URIs and HTTP links and uses Spotify's Metadata API (http://developer.spotify.com/en/metadata-api/overview/) to output the link info to the channel window.

Also works in query windows, though you might get unexpected results if you are not using the "(msgs)" window for queries. Comments/improvments regarding this are more than welcome!

Put the script in your Irssi scripts folder, run it and it just works. Tested in Perl 5.10.

Thanks to original script author Toni Viemer√∂ who saved me a lot of time.
